# startup.cnf
#
# This is the startup configuration file that BeebEm loads ONCE at startup.
#
# This file is hardwired to the same directory as beebem.mips


# File locations (DO NOT CHANGE IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!):
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Location of the GUI font:
SET GUI_FONT_LOC=resources/font5x8.bmp

# Location of the Owl:
SET GUI_OWL_LOC=resources/owl.bmp

# Location of the virtual keyboard graphic (must be a 256 color bmp file):
SET VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD_LOC=resources/virtualkeyboard.bmp

# Location of the Teletext (MODE7) font:
SET TELETEXT_FONT_LOC=resources/teletext.bmp

# Location of the ROM configuration file. This file determines which ROM image
# is loaded into which bank:
# SET ROMS_CONFIG_LOC=~/.beebem/config/romimg.rc

# Directory containing the ROM images:
# SET ROMS_DIR=~/.beebem/roms/

# The location of the default keyboard mapping file. This is always loaded 
# first prior to loading a disc images keyboard configuation file:
# SET DEFAULT_CONFIG_LOC=~/.beebem/config/default.kbd

# The forced keyboard mapping file. This is always loaded AFTER the disc images
# keyboard configuration file - so it forces settings ALWAYS:
# SET FORCED_CONFIG_LOC=~/.beebem/config/forced.kbd

# The default disc images directory. If you do not specify a fully quantified
# path to the disc image you wish to load, it is searched for at this location:
# SET DISC_IMAGES_DIR=/media/sdcard/ROMS/BEEB/

# The default save/load state directory:
# SET SAVES_DIR=~/.beebem/saves/

# The keyboard mappings repository. If the .kbd file does not reside in the 
# same directory as the disc image, then BeebEm searches here:
# SET KBD_MAPPINGS_DIR=~/.beebem/kbd/

# Skin widgets
SET SKIN=YES
#SET SKIN=NO

# Set stick handler to old one:
SET STICK=OLD


# Video emulation (both Graphics modes and Teletext):
# ---------------------------------------------------

# GP2x is normal way up (as you'd expect).
SET ORIENTATION=NORMAL

# GP2x is up-side down (thus the buttons Y, A, B & X become a D-Pad):
#SET ORIENTATION=FLIPPED

# Video emulation, TOP = scanlines 0-240, BOTTOM = scanlines 16-255,
# CENTER (or CENTRE) = scanlines 8-248, SCALED = Beeb's 256 scanlines are
# scaled to the GP2x's 240 scanlines (deletes every 16th scanline):
SET VSCALE=SCALED
#SET VSCALE=TOP
#SET VSCALE=BOTTOM
#SET VSCALE=CENTER


# VSYNC offset (you probably don't need to change this):
SET VSYNCOFFSET=NORMAL
#SET VSYNCOFFSET=NUDGE

# Sound:
# ------

# Set the volume to 30%:
SET VOLUME=50

# Set the volume to 0% (no sound at startup):
#SET VOLUME=0


# Processing speed:
# -----------------

# Set the GP2x's processor speed. Use 240 for teletext games and 200 for
# everything else, some games clock down, even with sound:

# Default to 200Mhz:
SET SPEED=200

#SET SPEED=150
#SET SPEED=160
#SET SPEED=170
#SET SPEED=180
#SET SPEED=190
#SET SPEED=200
#SET SPEED=210
#SET SPEED=220
#SET SPEED=230
#SET SPEED=240


# 8271 floppy discs:
# ------------------

# RO = Read Only, RW=Read Write.

# First floppy drive (0):
SET FD0_TAB=RO
#SET FD0_TAB=RW

# Second floppy drive (1):
SET FD1_TAB=RO
#SET FD1_TAB=RW

# Disable the hardware cursor always: '1', 'YES', 'TRUE', 'Y' equals a positive,
# everything else is considered a negative:
SET DISABLE_CURSOR=0
#SET DISABLE_CURSOR=1

# Default keys:
# -------------

# NOTHING = key is not mapped.
# VOLUME = key controls volume (only works on the actual volume buttons).

# Normal screen orientation:
LEFT=BBC_Z
RIGHT=BBC_X
